# Cloud Storage buckets

Create two private buckets in `europe-west2` (or your configured region):

- `BUCKET_MSDS` for MSDS PDFs
- `BUCKET_SPECS` for spec sheet PDFs

Object naming:
- `msds/{sku}/{timestamp}_{original_filename}.pdf`
- `specs/{sku}/{ingredient_batch_code}/{timestamp}_{original_filename}.pdf`

Buckets should be private with uniform access. Downloads require signed URLs generated by the service.
